## Backend deployed on `render.com`

## Local installation and execution
- `npm install`
- `npm install nodemon`
- `npm start`

Note that this is old backend deployed. It still wroks but it does no hve static files. Therefore old frontend deployed on firebse works with it but handling CORS issues is complicated as cookies are also affected. For this reason cookies do not seem to work in incognito mode, unless CORS issues are not present.
